# Fridge-Freezer
This project transforms a standard freezer into a digitally temperature-controlled unit using a DS18B20 temperature sensor. It allows the user to switch between "Refrigerator" and "Freezer" modes using a physical switch. The current mode and temperature are displayed on an I2C LCD. This system is developed using MicroPython on a Raspberry Pi Pico. By controlling the temperature through a relay, which turns the freezer on and off, this project can also revive freezers or refrigerators with malfunctioning thermostats. The freezer's built-in thermostat should be set to its highest setting.
